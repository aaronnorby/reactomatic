# Reactomatic 

A simple web app built using React, Redux, and D3 to pull all of a user's trips
from the [Automatic API](https://developer.automatic.com/api-reference/) and show a
graph of how the fuel efficiency of their vehicle relates to their average speed.
Right now the app only uses sample data from Automatic, not genuine user data. 

# Usage 

You can check out the app in action [here](http://reactomatic.herokuapp.com/).
